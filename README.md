Cometadata Suggestions is a hub to engage the COMET community to collect possible metadata enrichment pathways and get ideas and feedback on the future direction of COMET, including infrastructure development.

## How to Submit a Suggestion
> [!NOTE]
> We're interested in capturing feedback in an open and public forum on GitHub. If you would prefer not to use GitHub to submit your suggestion, feel free to send your suggestion to COMET's Project Lead, Dione Mentis, at [dione.mentis@datacite.org](mailto:dione.mentis@datacite.org). 

1. Go to the [Discussions](https://github.com/cometadata/cometadata-suggestions/discussions) tab in Cometadata Suggestions. 
2. We recommend first reviewing and searching the suggestions on the board to see if your suggestion has already been proposed.
   - If it has, you can contribute to the existing discussion by upvoting the feedback or replying with your use case. 
3. Click "New discussion." 
4. The Discussions board is divided into two categories: **General Suggestions** and **Metadata Enrichments**. Select the category that best fits your suggestion.
    - **General Suggestions** is for any feedback or ideas you have for the future direction of the COMET initiative.
    - **Metadata Enrichments** is for your proposals to submit enriched metadata and enrichment methods to the COMET initiative.
5. Fill in the template with as much information about your suggestion as possible.
6. Click "Start discussion." 

## What Happens Next?

We'll review your suggestion and get back to you. 

Keep an eye on your discussion in case that:
 - We need more information to better understand your suggestion. 
 - We have information to share with you about your suggestion.
